# The Selectatron

### Overview

PLEASE NOTE this is a work in progress, not ready for prime time but free to play in a dev environment and send some feedback.

This fieldtype for EE2 lets you select entries from multiple weblogs, and store their entry ids in a 12|22|44|45 format.

Primarily for use in embeds to templates with `exp:channel:entries` tags, and using the `fixed_order` parameter.

The fieldtype has a drag drop interface for ordering selections, and entry ids are stored in your selection order.
